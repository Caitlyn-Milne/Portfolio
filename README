This is the code for my portfilo website, Caitlynmilne.com 

If you're checking out my project take a look at:
index.html
main.js
Page.js
styles.css
for a sample of the work ive done for this project

this website is still in development, and is worked on in time to time in my free time.

Updates I plan to make (written as in version 0.3.6, last updated 0.6.0)
(COMPLETE) Fix a bug where changing the view port glitches out the events (viewport and pixel measurements are taken on page load instead of on viewport change)
(COMPLETE) Fix the fact smaller screens the skills and languages page overflows into contacts
(COMPLETE)Impliment a smoother loading transition, everything poppin in is abit jaring
(testing) Fix the bug where on mobile 2 titles can be seen for skills and languages
Add projects page (with 1/2 scroll or paralax scroll)
(COMPLETE) Add social media links on contacts
Either fix toolbar on ie or create a pop up for ie saying the page is not designed for it (will use see how much breaks on ie to decide)
(testing) Add fix where contacts dont show up (likely same bug as Fix a bug where changing the view port glitches out the events)

Once changes will be made, they will be ticked off by putting (COMPLETE) in front of them
